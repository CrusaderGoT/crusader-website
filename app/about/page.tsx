            👋 Hi, I&n2019;m @CrusaderGoT

👤 Real Name: Emeka ~ a-may-car
👀 I’m passionate about Python, especially with Django for web development, and I enjoy working with various libraries and technologies including:

🎶 Librosa for audio and music analysis,
🎥 Moviepy for video editing and manipulation,
🔢 Numpy and Scipy for scientific computing,
🖼️ PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing,
📊 Matplotlib for data visualization,
💻 HTML and CSS for frontend development,
🅱️ Bootstrap5 for responsive design.
🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my skills into JavaScript and diving deeper into Django REST framework for building RESTful APIs. I've also been experimenting with Tailwind CSS for modern and utility-first styling, and Geopy for geocoding and location-based services.

💡 In my recent ventures, I've explored database management with PostgreSQL using Psycopg2, deploying applications on platforms like Render, and API Integration.

🔭 Additionally, some of my personal projects not on GitHub, include an e-commerce website available on sale on Upwork; utilizing APIs from platforms like Reddit, Spotify, Twitter, and Meta for personal use.

🚀 Looking ahead, I aim to delve into cloud technologies like AWS, containerization with Docker, and dive deeper into machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).
