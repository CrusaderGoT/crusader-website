            👋 Hi, I&#39;m @CrusaderGoT

            👤 Real Name: Emeka ~ a-may-car
            👀 I&#39;`m passionate about Python, especially with Django for web development, and I enjoy working with various libraries and technologies including:

            🎶 Librosa for audio and music analysis,
            🎥 Moviepy for video editing and manipulation,
            🔢 Numpy and Scipy for scientific computing,
            🖼️ PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing,
            📊 Matplotlib for data visualization,
            💻 HTML and CSS for frontend development,
            🅱️ Bootstrap5 for responsive design.
            🌱 Currently, I&#39;m expanding my skills into JavaScript and diving deeper into Django REST framework for building RESTful APIs. I&#39;ve also been experimenting with Tailwind CSS for modern and utility-first styling, and Geopy for geocoding and location-based services.

            💡 In my recent ventures, I&#39;ve explored database management with PostgreSQL using Psycopg2, deploying applications on platforms like Render, and API Integration.

            🔭 Additionally, some of my personal projects not on GitHub, include an e-commerce website available on sale on Upwork; utilizing APIs from platforms like Reddit, Spotify, Twitter, and Meta for personal use.

            🚀 Looking ahead, I aim to delve into cloud technologies like AWS, containerization with Docker, and dive deeper into machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).
